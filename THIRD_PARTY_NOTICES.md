`src-tauri/binaries/manifest.json` records the downloaded engine release, asset URL, and SHA256 supplied by GitHub. Preserve that manifest and all license files when distributing binaries. Distributors must comply with the licenses of the exact FFmpeg build and its libraries, including providing corresponding source as required; upstream links alone are not a substitute for distributor obligations. This repository does not upload a public release automatically.
